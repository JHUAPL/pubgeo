These instructions are not complete and do not currently result in a working build. It is close, and subsets of the project have worked with PDAL. The final project could not be entirely integrated.

Download and run OSGeo4W64 Installer.
	Select advanced installation. Everything else until packages is default.
		From Command Line Utilities select:
			Gdal, gdal-dev, pdal
			Install packages to meet dependencies. (page after package selection)
	
Download and install visual studio 2017 community (REQUIRES SYSTEM-RESTART)
	Install packages:
		.Net desktop development (possibly unnecessary)
		Desktop development with c++
			** include c++/cli support, std lib mods, mfc and atl, win8.1 sdk **
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42701019/problems-generating-solution-for-vs-2017-with-cmake
	This combination of packages generates a compatible visual studio environment. Some packages may be unnecessary (mfc +atl, or .net desktop env)
		
	Load project (folder with CmakeLists.txt) AS 64 BIT!! VS will probably default you to X86
		Visual studio should start processing the cmake file
			cmake will probably fail:
				Missing c/cxx compiler
					see above package installation, you probably missed a package that was necessary in 2017 vs installation
				pdal config fails "file or directory x referenced by variable _foo does no exist ! (typo from source)
					edit C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\pdal\cmake\PDALConfig.cmake
						replace lines 31+ with: (Changing the OSGEO4W64_INSTALLATION_LOCATION respective to your installation directory) This is due PDAL being compiled on a different machine with a different folder structure
							set(OSGEO4W64_INSTALLATION_LOCATION "C:/OSGeo4W64/")
							set(PDAL_INCLUDE_DIRS "${OSGEO4W64_INSTALLATION_LOCATION}include")
							set(PDAL_LIBRARY_DIRS "${OSGEO4W64_INSTALLATION_LOCATION}lib")
							include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/PDALTargets.cmake")
							set(PDAL_LIBRARIES ${PDAL_LIBRARY_DIRS}/pdalcpp.lib ${PDAL_LIBRARY_DIRS}/pdal_util.lib)
							check_required_components(PDAL)

These instructions will generate a linker error missing what appear to be network conversions for ints/shorts/etc referenced in PDALs BEExtractor.
Possible solutions (Scott's best guesses)
    Perhaps un-defining 'WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN'? It was used to remove macros that were breaking the build. IE MAX(..) and MIN(..)
    PDAL build for windows on OSGeo package improperly built/configured (Partly already true
    Build PDAL on local machine and
